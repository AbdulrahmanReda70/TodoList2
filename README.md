### **Key Features & Innovations**

1. **Code Splitting**  
   - Applied **code splitting** to optimize the application's performance.  
   - **Benefit**: Improved load times by loading only the necessary code, resulting in a smoother user experience.

2. **User Experience Enhancements**  
   - **Redirection**: Smart redirects post-login to ensure users retain their actions without returning to the home page.  
   - **Search Params**: Used URL search parameters to display helpful messages after redirects.  
   - **Custom Error Pages**: Developed custom error pages for better error handling and feedback.  
   - **Popup Handling**: Ensured popups close when users click anywhere on the page, enhancing interaction.  
   - **Todo List App Enhancements**: Improved UX with automatic redirection to created lists, input clearing after task entry, and added keyboard shortcuts.

3. **Authentication with Supabase**  
   - **OAuth Integration**: Implemented **OAuth** for secure authentication.  
   - **Comprehensive Auth**: Integrated **sign-in and sign-up** functionality with Supabase.  
   - **Form Validation**: Used **React Hook Form & Zod** for professional, robust form validation.

4. **Protected Routes and User Roles**  
   - Applied **protected routes** and **user roles** with **React Router v6**.  
   - Ensured proper redirection based on user roles for secure access control.

5. **React Router v6 Features**  
   - Implemented **createBrowserRouter**, **loaders**, and **error handling** (using **ErrorElement**) for comprehensive routing and error management.

### **Notes & Miscellaneous**  
- **LocalStorage Management**: Utilized **localStorage** for data persistence, managing keys carefully to avoid unnecessary data retention.  
- **ProductV2 Section**: Demonstrates **protected routes** using the **Outlet** method. Visit the **Products** section for a clean UI demonstration.

### **Project Goals**  
This project was developed as a learning exercise to explore new technologies, React features, and best practices. While the UI may not be fully polished, I focused on implementing advanced features such as **code splitting**, **robust authentication**, and **enhanced user experience**. I'm proud of the functionality and the quality of the code.
